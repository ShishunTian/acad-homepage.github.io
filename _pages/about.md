Shishun Tian is currently an Associate Professor at the College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Shenzhen University. He received his Ph.D. in 2019 from the National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA) in Rennes, France. In the same year, he joined Shenzhen University, where he has been engaged in teaching and research in the fields of image/video quality assessment, computer vision, and deep learning. He was selected as a Class-C talent under the Shenzhen Peacock Plan for Overseas High-Level Talents. He has presided over research projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province. He has published over 40 papers in top-tier journals and conferences, including IEEE TIP, IEEE TMM, IEEE JSTSP, and TITS. He has also served as a reviewer for several prestigious journals and conferences, such as IEEE TPAMI, TIP, IEEE TCSVT, IEEE TMM, ACM SIGGRAPH, IEEE CVPR, and IEEE ICME.
